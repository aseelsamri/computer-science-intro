the program accepts a three-digit number. and checks if the number fullfills the conditions:
• The amount of the arithmetic sequence of the number 
• Is the number a "Kaprekar number" 
• Is the number a "special number"
Note:in this program first we check that the number entered is correct and within the three-digit range - if a number that is not within the range is entered, a message will be displayed accordingly and the user will be allowed to re-enter a number.
Sum of an invoice series from a number of a three-digit number - 
the unity digit will represent the first member of the series (a) 
the tens digit will represent the difference of the series (d)
the hundreds digit will represent the amount of members of the series(n). 
The program will print the sum of all members of the invoice series.
Example for the number 941:
d=4 a=1 n=9
(reminder - d*(n-1) + An= 1a)
Keperker number - Keperker number is a natural number. When you square the number, divide the resulting number into seven equal parts and add the two parts to get the original number. Example: 9 is a cracker number because-
9 = 1 + 8 <- 81 = 9*9￼
6174 =! 8276 + 3811 <- 38118276 = 6174*6174
2728 = 1984+ 744 <- 7441984= 2728*2728
6174 is not a Keperker number 
2728 is a Keperker number because
Note that if the number is squared with a two-digit amount of digits then its middle digit will belong to its right-hand side. You must check if the received number is a Cracker number and print a message accordingly.
(n = 9, a = 1, d = 4)
1 + 5 + 9 + 13 + 17 + 21 + 25 + 29 + 33 = 135￼
A special number - a number that is divisible by the sum of its own digits.
